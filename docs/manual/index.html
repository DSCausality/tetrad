<h3>The FGES Algorithm</h3>

<p>
Description: FGES is an optimized and parallelized version of an algorithm developed by Meek
[Meek, 1997] called the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES). The algorithm was further developed
and studied by Chickering [Chickering, 2002]. GES is a Bayesian algorithm that heuristically
searches the space of CBNs and returns the model with highest Bayesian score it finds. In
particular, GES starts its search with the empty graph. It then performs a forward stepping search in
which edges are added between nodes in order to increase the Bayesian score. This process
continues until no single edge addition increases the score. Finally, it performs a backward
stepping search that removes edges until no single edge removal can increase the score. For more
information see http://www.ccd.pitt.edu/pdfs/fgesc.pdf. The reference is Ramsey et al., 2017.
</p>

<p>
The algorithms requires a decomposable score—that is, a score that for the entire DAG model is a
sum of logged scores of each variables given its parents in the model. The algorithms can take all
continuous data (using the SEM BIC score), all discrete data (using the BDeu score) or a mixture
of continuous and discrete data (using the Conditional Gaussian score); these are all decomposable
scores.
</p>

<p>
Input Assumptions: Data that’s all continuous, all discrete, or a mixture of continuous and discrete
variables. Continuous variables will be assumed to be linearly associated; discrete predictor will be
assumed to be associated by multinomial conditional probability tables. Continuous variables for
the mixed case will be assumed to be jointly Gaussian.
</p>

<P> 
Output Format: A pattern, same as PC.

<h4>Parameters</h4>

<!-- Assign a class="table" for pretty look -->
<table class="table">

<thead>
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Sample prior</td>
<td> For the BDeu score (discrete variables), this is the effective sample
size added to each conditional probability table. Must be at least 1 (blame the 
90
Dirichlet distribution). Default 1.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Structure prior</td>
<td> For the BDeu score (discrete variables), this is the number of
variables one expects to see on average in any particular conditional probability
table. If one expects to see for the most part conditional models of variables with
two parents, then this should be set to 2. Default 1.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Penalty discount</td>
<td>  For the SEM BIC score (continuous variables), BIC is calculated
as BIC = 2 L – c k ln n, where L is the likelihood, k is the number of degrees of
freedom, n is the sample size, and c (the “penalty discount” is some positive
constant, usual greater than or equal to 1. Setting this to a larger number makes the
output of FGES sparser. Default 2.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Yes if the first step of FGES should do scoring for both X->Y and Y->X</td>
<td> For the
linear, Gaussian case, and for the multinomial case, the scores for these two
directions are guaranteed to be equal, but in some domains, like mixed variables
search, they are not, and the best score of the two should be used. Default false.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Yes if (one edge) faithfulness should be assumed</td>
<td>The algorithm will remove edges
X—Y in the initial step if X and Y are uncorrelated; this speeds up the algorithm
(See Maathuis, ??, Ramsey et al., ??). However, this may remove edges that the
original GES algorithm would not remove, so an additional pass through the
algorithm may need to be done to pick up these additional edges and guarantee
correctness. This should be set to Yes if the additional pass should not be done, No
if the additional pass should be done. Default false.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>The maximum degree of the graph</td>
<td> For some graphs, FGES may be inclined to find
many adjacents for particular nodes, and in the forward step it will add adjacents
that will later be removed in the backward step. To keep such edges from being
added, one may specify a maximum degree for the graph. In the forward step, fGES
will not add edges that results in the degree of any node exceeding this maximum.
Default 100.</td>
